# Assembly & Virtualization Challenge

That's a challenge where u need to create a game


 - but using only assembly
 - but you should implement your assembler
 - but your assembler should produces the binary to run on a OS
 - but you have to build the OS yourself
 - but the OS should run on a Win32 hosted Hypervisor
 - but you need to be alive at the end

# Approach

I'm firsting building my assembler following the Assembly MIPS (RISC 32) architecture


while I learn how to actually program in c++ which I never programmed before


after that I don't really know, right now my levels of expectation are really low

# Should you look at this as a reference project to build your own assembler?

No
